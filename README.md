# Tinyraytracer_learning



 This project is a minimalist ray‑tracing renderer written in pure C++ . 
 It demonstrates the full process—from casting rays from a camera, intersecting them with scene spheres, computing diffuse and specular reflections as well as refractions, to finally outputting a PPM image. 
 
 This project is still a work in progress and more functionalities will be integrated into the project going forward.
